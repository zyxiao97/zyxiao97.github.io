I am Zhuoyu Xiao (肖卓宇), a Ph.D. student in Operations Research at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://udaybag2.github.io/).  Prior to that, I received my B.S. (Honours) in Mathematics (Elite Undergraduate Program) from [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in 2020 and an M.Phil. in Mathematics from [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jane J. Ye](https://web.uvic.ca/~janeye/).

Education
======
- University of Michigan, Ph.D. in Operations Research, (Expected 2026)
- University of Victoria, M.Phil. in Mathematics, 2022
- Jinan University, B.S. in Mathematics (Elite Undergraduate Program), 2020

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on developing and analyzing algorithms for solving optimization, games, and equilibrium problems complicated by **nonconvexity, nonmonotonicity, nonsmoothness, and stochasticity**, arising in power systems and markets, network models, and statistical learning. The techniques I use draw from a variety of fields including probability theory, modern optimization, variational analysis, and variational inequalities. In my research, I frequently use the following monographs:

- [First-Order Methods in Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997) (Beck).
- [Modern Nonconvex Nondifferentiable Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976748) (Cui and Pang).
- [Lectures on Stochastic Programming: Modeling and Theory](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976595) (Shapiro, Dentcheva, and Ruszczynski).
- [Finite-Dimensional Variational Inequalities and Complementarity Problems](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b97543) (Facchinei and Pang).
- [Variational Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-02431-3) (Rockafellar and Wets).
