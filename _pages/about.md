I am Zhuoyu Xiao (肖卓宇), a Ph.D. student in Operations Research at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://udaybag2.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in 2020 and an M.Phil. in Mathematics from the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Jane J. Ye.

Research Interests
======
My research interests focuses on designing, developing and analyzing algorithms for solving nonsmooth optimization, nonconvex optimization, and stochastic optimization, with a strong focus on nonconvex games. In my research, I frequently use the following monographs:

1. [An Easy Path to Convex Analysis and Applications](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-02406-1) by Boris S. Mordukhovich and Nguyen Mau Nam.
2. [First-order methods in optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997) by Amir Beck.
