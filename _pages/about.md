I am Zhuoyu Xiao (肖卓宇), a Ph.D. student in Operations Research at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://udaybag2.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in 2020 and an M.Phil. in Mathematics from the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Jane J. Ye.

Research Interests
======
My research interests focuses on designing, developing and analyzing algorithms for solving nonsmooth optimization, nonconvex optimization, and stochastic optimization, with a strong focus on nonconvex games. In my research, I frequently use the following monographs:

1. [Convex Analysis and Nonlinear Optimization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-31256-9_4) (Borwein and Lewis).
2. [First-order Methods in Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997) (Beck).
3. [Modern Nonconvex Nondifferentiable Optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976748) (Cui and Pang).
4. [Lectures on Stochastic Programming: Modeling and Theory](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976595) (Shapiro, Dentcheva, and Ruszczynski).
5. [Finite-dimensional Variational Inequalities and Complementarity Problems](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b97543) (Facchinei and Pang).
6. [Variational Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-02431-3) (Rockafellar and Wets).
