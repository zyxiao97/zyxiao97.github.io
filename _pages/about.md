I am Zhuoyu Xiao (肖卓宇), a Ph.D. student in Operations Research at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://udaybag2.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) in 2020, a M.Phil. in Mathematics from [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jane J. Ye](https://web.uvic.ca/~janeye/).
