I am Zhuoyu Xiao (肖卓宇), a Ph.D. student in Operations Research at University of Michigan. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](https://udaybag2.github.io/). My research interests focuses on designing, developing and analyzing algorithms for solving nonsmooth optimization, nonconvex optimization, and stochastic programming, with a strong focus on nonconvex games.
